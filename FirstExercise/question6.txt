1. Total sum: 987459712; Time taken to sum all the numbers are 0.176635
2. Total sum: 987459712; Time taken to sum all the numbers are 0.107492

3. The two run times differ in the time taken to sum all the numbers. I observed that despite the total sum for both programs being the same, one program runs faster than another. It seems that the multi-threaded program runs faster on average to sum all the numbers compared to the single-threaded program.

4. With less elements inside the array used in the multi-threaded program is seems that the run time is faster. However, the run time is still faster than the single-threaded program if you decreased the amount of elements inside of the array in that program as well.
